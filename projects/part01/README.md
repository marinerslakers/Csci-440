# Part 1: ER Diagram

Draw an ER diagram for your database design. You may use any software tool of
your choice, but handwritten ER diagrams will not be accepted. Use Chapters 3
as your guide.

Guidelines:

1. Make sure to indicate:
    * Keys
    * All attributes
    * Composite attributes (if any)
    * Meaningful derived attributes (if any)
    * Relationship attributes (if any)
    * Weak entities (if any)
    * Cardinality constraints
    * Participation constraints
2. If there are extra constraints that cannot be captured by the ER diagram,
   make sure you list them in supplementary text.
3. List any assumptions you make in the process.
4. Add relationships present in the data.
5. For each entity and relationship, write a short description in plain English
   of what it represents or models. One or two sentences per entity set and
   relationship is enough. These descriptions are primarily to help the grader
   understand the choices you made in modeling your data.

What to submit?
* As a group, in `Project Part01 Group` on
  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) submit a single PDF containing your
  ER diagram and text describing constraints not captured by the ER diagram as
  well as the role/meaning of each entity and relationship in your diagram.
* Individually, in `Project Part01 Individual` on
  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) submit a single PDF containing the
  contribution made by each team member.
