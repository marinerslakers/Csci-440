# Getting started

Open connection and REPL for sqlite

    $ sqlite3 <db-file-name>

List the tables

    > .tables

Read in data from last time (you may need to update the path)

    > .read 2018-10-17-script.sql

Try running tables again and you should now see a table

    > .tables
    Movie     Rating    Reviewer

Lets see what the schema looks like

    > .schema
    CREATE TABLE Movie(mID int, title text, year int, director text);
    CREATE TABLE Rating(rID int, mID int, stars int, ratingDate date);
    CREATE TABLE Movie(mID int, title text, year int, director text);

# More about Creating

We can see some additional

## Non-null Constraint

What if we didn't want to allow `NULL`? When we create the table, we can add a
non-null constraint (e.g. `not null` in the create statement:

    > drop table if exists Employee;
    > create table Employee(id int not null, ssn text);
    > insert into Employee values (null, '123')
    Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: Employee.id

## Primary Keys

Or, what if we wanted to specify the primary key (e.g. the `primary key(id)` in
the create statement:

    > drop table if exists Employee;
    > create table Employee(id int not null, ssn text, primary key(id));
    > insert into Employee values (1, '123'), (2, '345');
    > insert into Employee values (1, '789');
    Error: UNIQUE constraint failed: Employee.id

## Other Unique attributes

Or other values that should be unique using the `unique` constraint:

    > drop table if exists Employee;
    > create table Employee(id int , ssn text unique);
    > insert into Employee values (1, '123'), (2, '345');
    > insert into Employee values (3, '123');
    Error: UNIQUE constraint failed: Employee.ssn

## Default Values

Sometimes default values are helpful (but not if it is a primary key).  Also,
note that if we have defaults, we can use a different syntax for an insert.

    > drop table if exists Employee;
    > create table Employee(id int default 1, ssn text);
    > insert into Employee(ssn) values ('123');
    > select * from Employee;

## Foreign Key Constraints

In SQLite, we will need to make sure that foreign keys are enforced (other
relational dbs enable by default).  To enable run:

    > paragma foreign_keys=on;

We can guarantee that the target of a foreign key is not missing by using
a foreign key constraint.  For example, if we have a department table:

    > drop table if exists Department;
    > create table Department(id int, name text, primary key(id));
    > insert into Department values (1, 'CS'), (2, 'Engineering');

Now, lets insert some employees in departments

    > drop table if exists Employee;
    > create table Employee(
        id int,
        name text,
        department_id int,
        primary key(id),
        foreign key (department_id) references Department(id)
    );
    > insert into Employee values (1, 'A', 2), (2, 'B', 1);

And lets inspect the data by making a query that prints name and department name

    > select Employee.name as employee_name, Department.name as department_name
        from Employee
        inner join Department on department_id = Department.id;

Now, lets try to insert an employee with a department id that is invalid

    sqlite> insert into Employee values (3, 'C', 4);
    Error: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed

## Deleting Records

What happens if we delete a record that is the target of a foreign key?  Let's
try to delete the 'CS' department:

    > delete from Department where name = 'CS';
    Error: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed

We could perform multiple operations, but we can do better by telling the
database what we would like it to do.  There are a lot of options, so lets start
with the simplest and set to null (we can set to null since there is no non-null
constraint).  For this exercise, I recommend adding the commands to a file
called query.sql and we can `.read` the query.  That will allow us to play with
the query a bit.

Create a file called `query.sql` and add the following:

    drop table if exists Employee;
    drop table if exists Department;

    create table Department(id int, name text, primary key(id));
    insert into Department values (1, 'CS'), (2, 'Engineering');

    create table Employee(
        id int,
        name text,
        department_id int,
        primary key(id),
        foreign key (department_id) references Department(id) on delete set null
    );
    insert into Employee values (1, 'A', 2), (2, 'B', 1);

Now, lets run the query:

    > .read query.sql
    employee_name  department_name
    -------------  ---------------
    A              Engineering
    B              CS

And again try to delete the CS:

    > delete from Department where name = 'CS';

Now it should have succeeded.  Lets see our employee list (our department id
that was 'CS' is now NULL).

    > select * from Employee;
    id          name        department_id
    ----------  ----------  -------------
    1           A           2
    2           B

An alternative option is to delete the referencing records using the `cascade`
option.  Let update `query.sql` to cascade the delete.

Change the line

    foreign key (department_id) references Department(id) on delete set null

To the line:

    foreign key (department_id) references Department(id) on delete cascade

Now, lets run again

    > .read query.sql
    employee_name  department_name
    -------------  ---------------
    A              Engineering
    B              CS

And again try to delete the CS:

    > delete from Department where name = 'CS';

Now it should have succeeded.  Lets see our employee list the employee in the
'CS' department should be removed.

    > select * from Employee;
    id          name        department_id
    ----------  ----------  -------------
    1           A           2
