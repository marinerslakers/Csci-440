# Updating Data

Open connection and REPL for sqlite

    $ sqlite3 <db_name>

List the tables

    > .tables

Read in data from last time (you may need to update the path)

    > .read 2018-10-19

Try running tables again and you should now see a table

    > .tables
    Movie     Rating    Reviewer

Lets see what the schema looks like

    > .schema
    CREATE TABLE Movie(mID int, title text, year int, director text);
    CREATE TABLE Rating(rID int, mID int, stars int, ratingDate date);
    CREATE TABLE Movie(mID int, title text, year int, director text);

# Updating

Updates have the form

    update <table>
    set <attrib> = ...

So for example, if we wanted to set all ratings to 5 stars we could:

    > update Rating set stars = 5

We can even update a subset of tuples, for examples, we can remove a start from
all moves rated on 2011-01-20

    > update Rating set stars = stars - 1 where ratingDate = '2011-01-20'

Review: Check that all went ok by selecting all tuples with rating date
'2011-01-20' have rating 4 and ones without that date have rating 5.

    > select * from Rating where ratingDate = '2011-01-20';
    > select * from Rating where ratingDate != '2011-01-20';

# Joins

What if I wanted you to remove a start from any movie after 2000?  Joins will
help us.  (See notes for info on joins)

Lets try first lets produce a query that joins Rating and Movie to give us
title, starts and ratingDate.  E.g.

    title               stars       ratingDate
    ------------------  ----------  ----------
    Gone with the Wind  5           2011-01-09
    Gone with the Wind  5           2011-01-22
    Gone with the Wind  5           2011-01-27
    The Sound of Music  4           2011-01-20
    The Sound of Music  5           2011-01-27
    E.T.                5           2011-01-02
    E.T.                5           2011-01-22

    Raiders of the Los  5           2011-01-12
    Raiders of the Los  5           2011-01-30

One way to make the query is

    > select title, stars, ratingDate
    from Movie
        inner join Rating on Movie.mID = Rating.mID;

Lets add the reviewers name

    > select title, stars, name, ratingDate
    from Movie
        inner join Rating on Movie.mID = Rating.mID
        inner join Reviewer on Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID;

We can also rewrite as

    > select title, stars, name, ratingDate
    from Movie, Rating, Reviewer
    where Movie.mID = Rating.mID and Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID;

# Back to updating

Now we have all the tools to remove a start from new movies

First, lets make sure we select the correct tuples.

    select * from
    Movie inner join Rating on Movie.mID = Rating.mID
    where Movie.year > 1980;

Great, next, lets get just the ids

    > select rID
    from Movie inner join Rating on Movie.mID = Rating.mID
    where Movie.year > 1980;

There are duplicates, lets remove them with `select distinct`:

    > select distinct rID
    from Movie inner join Rating on Movie.mID = Rating.mID
    where Movie.year > 1980;

Now, lets put together our query

    > update Rating
    set stars = stars - 1
    where Rating.rID in (
        select distinct rID
        from Movie INNER JOIN Rating on Movie.mID = Rating.mID
        where Movie.year > 1980
    );

# Renaming

Sometimes, we may want to rename tables, we can do so with the `as` keyword For
example.  We can rewrite the previous example as:

    > select title, stars, name, ratingDate
    from Movie as M,
      Rating as R1,
      Reviewer as R2
    where M.mID = R1.mID and R2.rID = R1.rID;

Or even columns

    > select title as t, stars as s, name as n, ratingDate as d
    from Movie as M,
      Rating as R1,
      Reviewer as R2
    where M.mID = R1.mID and R2.rID = R1.rID;

Lets do some problems:

1. Add the reviewer Roger Ebert to your database, with an rID of 209.
2. Insert 5-star ratings by James Cameron for all movies in the database.  Leave
   the review date as NULL.
3. For all movies that have an average rating of 4 stars or higher, add 25 to
   the release year.
4. Remove all ratings where the movie's year is before 1970 or after 2000, and
   the rating is fewer than 4 stars.
