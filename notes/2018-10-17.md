# Getting started

Open connection and REPL for sqlite

    $ sqlite3 <db_name>

List the tables

    > .tables

Create a table

    > create table Movie(mID int, title text, year int, director text);

Try running tables again and you should now see a table

    > .tables
    Movie

Lets see what the schema looks like

    > .schema Movie
    CREATE TABLE Movie(mID int, title text, year int, director text);

Let's add data

    > insert into Movie values(101, 'Gone with the wind', 1939, 'Victor Fleming');

Let's see some data

    > select * from Movies;
    101|Gone with the wind|1939|Victor Fleming

Great!  We are making queries.  Let's add more data

    > insert into Movie values(101, 'Gone with the Wind', 1939, 'Victor Fleming');
    > insert into Movie values(102, 'Star Wars', 1977, 'George Lucas');
    > insert into Movie values(103, 'The Sound of Music', 1965, 'Robert Wise');
    > insert into Movie values(104, 'E.T.', 1982, 'Steven Spielberg');
    > insert into Movie values(105, 'Titanic', 1997, 'James Cameron');
    > insert into Movie values(106, 'Snow White', 1937, null);
    > insert into Movie values(107, 'Avatar', 2009, 'James Cameron');
    > insert into Movie values(108, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 1981, 'Steven Spielberg');

# Using Select

Lets make a more interesting query.  Find all movies made after 1980:

    > select * from Movie where year > 1980;

How about all movies made by James Cameron:

    > select * from Movie where director = 'James Cameron';

# Using Project

What if we only wanted the names and years of movies:

    > select title, year from Movie;

Now, let's put some things together

    > select title, year from Movie where director = 'James Cameron';

# Removing data

Removing data has the form

    > delete from <table_name> where <condition>

Example lets remove all of James Cameron's movies

    > delete from Movie where director = 'James Cameron';
    > select * from Movie;
    > select * from Movie where director = 'James Cameron';

Lets get rid of the whole table:

    > drop table Movie;
    > .table

# Running sql scripts

If we really want to do some interesting things we will probably want to load
data more easily.

    > .read 2018-10-17-my-script.sql
