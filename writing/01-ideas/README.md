# Project Ideas Deliverable

Provide three ideas for a tutorial.  For each idea write a paragraph that
address the following.
1. Provide a working title for the tutorial.
2. Provide an objective.  That is, what do you hope the reader will learn by
   working through your tutorial.
3. Provide a description of the value.  That is, why should someone spend their
   time reading from your tutorial.

## Submitting your work

I will only need one submission per group.  You will issue a public PR for your
group, so, you may want to use a different fork than the one that you have been
using for other projects of the course.

To submit, fork the course repository.  See [SETUP](../projects/part03/SETUP.md)
to get started with forking a repo.  In your fork of the repository, write your
ideas in the file [ideas.md](./ideas.md).  Issue a pull request to the
course repository (I will show you how to issue a PR in class).
