# Creating an ER Diagram
The objective of this tutorial is to teach how to create an ER Diagram. We will use given entities and relationships and show how to convert them to an ER Diagram,
showing how the attributes and types should be formatted. This is a valuable tool for people to know as it can allow them to clearly communicate the requirements
of a database and have a clear stepping-off point when going deeper into database creation.

# Getting Started with SQL
The objective of this tutorial is to go over basic sql queries using Sqlite 3. Namely, we will go over how to create a table, insert and delete values from that table,
and how to display data from the database. This will be a particularly useful skill for anyone who needs to work with databases as queries can make navigating and
displaying data so much easier. We will use Sqlite3 as an example for its ease of use and low overhead.

# Normalizing a Database
This tutorial's objective will be to teach others how to normalize relationships. We will definitely at least go over 1NF and 2NF, as these are extremely important for
an uncluttered database. This will be a valuable skill for beginning database administrators as they will be able to use this information to give themselves the best
efficiency in their databases.
